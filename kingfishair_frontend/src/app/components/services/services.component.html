      <h2>Checked-in Baggage</h2>
      <p>
        What is a Carry-on Bag? A carry- on bag is the type of luggage travelers are allowed
        to take into an airplane. These baggages are transported in the cargo area of
        the plane. Checking luggage means you do not have to carry it through the airport.
        If you have more to pack than will fit in a carry-on, it is best to chose this option!

      <h2>Pet on board!</h2>
      <p>
        The logistics of leaving your pet at home while youâ€™re on a trip are tricky,
        we understand that. That's why KingfishAir allows dogs and cats in the passenger
        cabin of our aircraft. Your pet and its carrier must not exceed 10 kilograms
        (about 20 pounds) in total weight. Travel Carrier: Your pet's carrier must be
        airline-approved and measure no more than 55 x 40 x 25 cm.
